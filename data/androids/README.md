This folder is to import the 
Androids-corpus (androids)
containing data from 112 people, 64 of them diagnozed with depression and 52 as a control group.
Described in the upcoming paper "The Androids Corpus: A New Publicly AvailableBenchmark for Speech Based Depression Detection" by Fuxiang Tao, Anna Esposito and Alessandro Vinciarelli (Interspeech 2023)

I used the version downloadable from [Dropbox, mentioned in this github page](https://github.com/androidscorpus/data)

Download and unzip the file Androids-corpus.zip to the current folder
