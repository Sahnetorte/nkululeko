This folder is to import the 
The Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset (CREMA-D)
database to nkululeko.

I used the version downloadable from [github](https://github.com/CheyneyComputerScience/CREMA-D)

downloaded April 27th 2023

Download and unzip or git clone the archive

I only used the AudioWAV subdirectory
